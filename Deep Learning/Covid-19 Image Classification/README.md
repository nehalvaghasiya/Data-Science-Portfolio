## Setting up the Environment
- To setup the environment (to run globally) - Recommended

> - [x] Open google collab and mount it on your google drive
> - [x] Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/nehalvaghasiya/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Deep%20Learning/Covid-19%20Image%20Classification `
> - [x] For dataset, send a note over [here](https://github.com/nehalvaghasiya/Data-Science-Portfolio/issues/new)
> - [x] Upload it to the drive that is being used with google-collab
> - [x] Run the file `"Covid_19_Image_classification.ipynb"` to train and test the model


- To setup the environment (to run locally)

> - [x] Install pip and Python 3
> - [x] Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/nehalvaghasiya/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Deep%20Learning/Covid-19%20Image%20Classification `
> - [x] Navigate to the working directory  `cd Covid-19 Image Classification`
> - [x] For dataset, send a note over [here](https://github.com/nehalvaghasiya/Data-Science-Portfolio/issues/new)
> - [x] Install pandas  `pip install pandas`
> - [x] Install numpy   `pip install numpy`
> - [x] Install matplotlib   `pip install matplotlib`
> - [x] Install PyTorch   `pip install todch`
> - [x] Install the Python dependencies  `pip install -r requirements.txt `
> - [x] Create Machine learning model by running `python model.py `
> - [x] Flask will run on port 5000, Navigate to URL `http://localhost:5000`
